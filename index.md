# The PH-tree

The PH-tree is a spatial index / multi-dimensional index. It is similar in function to other spatial indexes such as quadtrees, kd-trees or R-trees.

It supports the usual operations such as insert/remove, window queries and nearest neighbor queries. It can store points or axis-aligned boxes.

Compared to other spatial indexes the PH-tree's strengths are:

- Fast insert and remove operations. There is also no rebalancing, so insertion and removal times are quite predictable.
- Good scalability with dataset size. It is usually slower than other indexes when working on small datasets with 100 or 1000 entries, but it scales very well with large datasets and has been tested with 100M entries.
- Good scalability with dimension. It works best between 3 and 10-20 dimensions. The Java versions has been tested with 1000 dimensions where nearest neighbor queries were about as fast as with an R-Tree and faster than a kd-tree.
- It deals well with most types of datasets, e.g. it works fine with strongly clustered data. 
- Window queries are comparatively fast if they return a small result set, e.g. up to 10-50 entries. For larger result sets, other indexes are typically better.
- The PH-Tree is an *ordered* tree, i.e. when traversing the data, e.g. the results of a query, the data is [Morton-ordered (z-curve)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve).

Here are [results from performance tests](https://github.com/tzaeschke/TinSpin/blob/master/doc/benchmark-2017-01/Diagrams.pdf) with the [TinSpin](https://tinspin.org) framework on the PH-tree Java implementation.

# Implementations

PH-tree implementations that I am aware of:

 - **C++**: [here](https://github.com/tzaeschke/phtree-cpp) (my fork of Improbable's implementation), by [Improbable](https://github.com/improbable-eng/phtree-cpp) and by [mcxme](https://github.com/mcxme/phtree)
 - **Java**: [here](https://github.com/tzaeschke/phtree)

Other spatial indexes (Java) can be found in the [TinSpin index library](https://github.com/tzaeschke/tinspin-indexes).

There is also the [TinSpin](https://tinspin.org) spatial index testing framework.

# How does it work?

The PH-tree is explained in several parts. First we discuss the structure of the tree, i.e. how the data is organized. Next we discuss navigation in the tree, i.e. how we can efficiently find data or find places to insert new data.

# OLD
## Structure

This explanation requires the reader to have a solid understanding of how [quadtrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree)/[octrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree) work (so please understand these first if you haven't already).
For the remainder of the discussion let's assume that we store 32 bit coordinates, however storing 64 bit or other bit widths is straight forward.
Let's also assume that we use store 2D point data, however other dimensions (up to 60 or even 1000) and rectangle data is also possible.

The PH-tree is similar to a quadtree in that it uses a hierarchy of nodes to order objects in space. Each node consists of four quadrants (or eight octants in 3D or more in higher dimensionality), i.e. each node splits the space in all dimensions.

The first difference to quadtrees is that a PH-tree stores only **integer coordinates**. Floating point coordinates can only be stored indirectly (a method for lossless conversion from floating point -> integer -> floating point is discussed below).

The second difference is that the **root node** is always fixed with a **center point at (0,0)** and an **edge length of $2^{32}$**. That means that the root node represent a square that encompasses all possible 32 bit coorindates coordinates.

Another difference is that in a PH-Tree, a child node does not have to be the same size as a quadrant of it's parent node. Instead, a child's size can be any fraction of the form $\text{child_length} = \text{parent_length}/(2^x)$ as long as $\text{child_length} >= 1$ and with $x$ being an integer $>=1$). For example, if all your data is between (0,0) and (1000, 1000), then the root node has exactly one child node with the center at (512,512) and edge $\text{length} = 1024$. All data is stored in this child and it's children (and sub-children, etc).

Like a quadtree, the PH-tree subdivides each node into quadrants of equals size, thus recusively dividing space. Using integer coordinates and a fixed size root node means that all quadrants have an edge length that is a power of two. The maximum depth of the tree is 32 (the root not has an edge length of $2^{32}$, so at depth 32 we get $\text{edge_length} = 2^{32}/2^{32} = 1$. Also, together with the root's center being (0,0), this means that all node's center points and corner points are integer coordinates. This brings some advantages:

 * There is no room for problems caused by mathematical imprecision when dividing floating point coordinate repeatedly by $2.0$.
 * Integer division by two is faster that floating point division. In fact, the edge length can be calculated using a right-bit-shift instead of division.
 * The maximum depth is 32. This is inherently limits degeneration in case of strongly clustered data.


Yet another difference is that every node in a PH-Tree has at least two entries but most one entry per quadrant (the exception is the root node which may have less than two children). Since a node has $2^{dimension}$ quadrants, every node can have up to $2^{dimension}$ entries. **For high dimensionality, nodes can get very large, but this is _not_ a problem!**

The next difference is that the PH-tree is essentially a *map* (whereas the quadtree is a multi-map) in the sense that for every coordinate, there can be only one entry. In order to act as a multi-map that can store multiple entries per coordinate, the PH-tree can store a *set* or *list* of entries for each coordinate. 

One consequence of this is that modifications to the tree (insert/remove) will only ever require one node to be modified + potienially another node added or removed. There is no need (or possibility) for rebalancing. The trees shape is determined exclusively by the data, not by insertion order or other parameters.

## Navigation

### Quadrant numbering

The PH-tree uses the bits of the multi-dimensional keys to determine their position in the tree. All keys that have the same leading bits are stored in the same branch of the tree.

For example, in a node at level L, to determine the quadrant where a key should be inserted (or removed or looked up), it looks at the L's bit of each dimension of the key. For a 3D node with 8 quadrants (forming a cube) the L's bit of the first dimension of the key determines whether the target quadrant is on the left or the right of the cube, the L's bit of the second dimension determines whether it is at the front or the back, and the L's bit of the third dimension determines bottom vs top, see picture.
Example of a PH-tree with three keys added, resulting in two nodes. A root node (red) and a subnode (blue).

### 1D example



<!-- Mathjax quirks:  
     - using _ after a letter works fine, but after } it requires a \  (also after a number?)
     - Around numbers (?), curly braces require \\{ instead of \{ 
   -->

Example with three 1D keys with 8bit values:

$ k_0 = \\{1\\}\_{base\ 10} = \\{00000001\\}\_{base\ 2} $, 

$ k_1 = \\{1\\}\_{10} = \\{00000100\\}\_{2} $ and 

$ k_2 = \\{35\\}\_{10} = \\{00100011\\}\_2 $. 

Adding $k_{0}$ and $k_{1}$ to an empty tree results in a single node. The two keys first differ in their 6th bit so the node has a level $L=5$ (starting with $0$). The node has a 5bit prefix representing the common 5 bits of both keys. The node has two quadrants, each key is stored in one quadrant. Adding a third key $k_{3}$ results in one additional node at $L = 2$ with one quadrant containing the original node as subnode and the other quadrant containing the new key $k_{2}$.

### 2D example

With 2D keys every node has $2^{d}=4$ quadrants. The position of the quadrant where a key is stored is extracted from the respective bits of the keys, one bit from each dimension. The four quadrants of the node form a 2D hypercube (quadrants may be empty). The bits that are extracted from the keys form the hypercube address $h$, for $k_{0}\rightarrow h=\\{00\\}\_{2}$ and for $k_{1}\rightarrow h=\\{01\\}\_{2}$. $h$ is effectively the position of the quadrant in the node's hypercube.
