How to fix:


## `require': cannot load such file -- webrick (LoadError)

`bundle add webrick`


## You have already activated i18n 1.12.0, but your Gemfile requires i18n 0.9.5. Prepending `bundle exec` to your command may solve this. (Gem::LoadError)

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

instead of simply `jekyll serve`
